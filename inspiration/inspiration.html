            <p>I often use Pinterest for inspiration because I feel like it has a lot to offer. Iâ€™ve curated my feed to be perfect for me  and I really enjoy making different boards, so that whenever I need to feel inspired, I can look at it.

            <p>Larsen is a fashion photography and director of a fashion  
                magazine from the 70s-80s. His magazine was primarily
                image based and composed of his bold, sometimes 
                provacative photography. I recieved one of his magazines 
                as a gift and it inspired me to consider going into
                publication design</p>
